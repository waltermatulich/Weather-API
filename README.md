An application where you type in a city & recieve the current weather as well as the 5 day forecast. As part of this website, in the search history bar the previous searched items remain and you can tap them and their current and future 5 day weather data will be displayed. I accessed this information via APIs in this case a weather API from weathermap.com in order to obtain current data worldwide! This website also works for cities outside the United States. Cheers!
